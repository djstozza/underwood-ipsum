## Underwood-ipsum

[underwood-ipsum.herokuapp.com](https://underwood-ipsum.herokuapp.com)

It is safe to say that I am a House of Cards tragic and a fan of Kevin Spacey in general. After being exposed to lorem ipsum, as well as well as custom ipsum sites, such as [Samuel L. Ipsum](http://slipsum.com/), [Hipster Ipsum](http://hipsum.co/) and [Picksum Ipsum](http://www.picksumipsum.co.uk/), I felt inspired to make my own ipsum generator. Underwood-ipsum uses Nokogiri to scrape various websites, such as IMDB to obtain quotes from notable Kevin Spacey roles.

***

## What was used?

* Nokogiri
* Ruby on Rails

***

## Still to come:

* Using a framework such as React.js to make the site more dynamic
* I am thinking of making another ipsum site: Game of Thrones Ipsum!
